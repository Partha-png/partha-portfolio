## the problem with coding interviews

let's be real - coding interviews can be intimidating. you're sitting there, someone's watching you code, and your brain decides to forget literally everything you've ever learned. sounds familiar? yeah, me too.

so i thought... what if there was an ai assistant that could help? not to cheat (that's lame), but to actually learn better and practice smarter.

---

## what i'm building

**fkleetcode** - an ai-assisted interview helper that:
- analyzes coding problems and breaks them down
- gives hints when you're stuck (not solutions!)
- explains concepts you're struggling with
- tracks your progress and weak areas
- simulates real interview scenarios

basically, it's like having a patient mentor who doesn't judge you for forgetting how hashmap works for the 100th time lol

---

## the tech stack

since this is an ml/ai project, here's what i'm using:

**backend:**
- python (obviously)
- langchain for the ai orchestration
- openai/gemini for the llm
- faiss for storing problem embeddings

**frontend:**
- next.js + typescript
- tailwind css (keeping it simple)
- real-time websockets for the interview simulation

---

## cool features i'm working on

### 1. smart hint system
instead of just giving you the answer, it asks questions:
- "have you considered using a different data structure?"
- "what's the time complexity of your current approach?"
- "can you optimize this nested loop?"

### 2. interview simulation mode
practice with an ai interviewer that:
- asks follow-up questions like a real interviewer
- checks your thought process, not just the code
- gives constructive feedback after

### 3. progress tracking
see where you're struggling:
- weak on dynamic programming? here are similar problems
- good at arrays but terrible at trees? focus areas highlighted
- track improvement over time

## challenges i'm facing

**making hints actually helpful:**
too vague = useless. too specific = basically the answer. finding the sweet spot is hard.

**avoiding the "just use chatgpt" problem:**
why use this when you can just ask chatgpt? fair point. but this is designed specifically for interview prep with structured learning paths.

**keeping latency low:**
nobody wants to wait 10 seconds for a hint during practice. optimizing the llm calls is tricky.

## current status

right now it's in early development. i've got:
- ✅ basic problem analysis working
- ✅ hint generation (still needs fine-tuning)
- ✅ simple ui for practice
- 🚧 interview simulation mode (in progress)
- 🚧 progress tracking dashboard (planned)

---

## why build this?

honestly? i was preparing for interviews myself and got frustrated with existing tools. most are either:
- just problem lists (thanks leetcode, very helpful)
- too expensive ($50/month? nah)
- not interactive enough

plus, it's a great excuse to work with langchain and learn about ai agent design.

---

## what's next

planning to add:
- voice-based interviews (practice explaining out loud)
- company-specific prep modes (faang, startup, etc)
- peer practice matching (1v1 mock interviews)
- open source the core engine

---

## try it out (eventually)

still building, but if you're interested, star the repo: 
[github.com/Partha-png/fkleetcode](https://github.com/Partha-png/fkleetcode)

and hey, if you have ideas or feedback, hit me up! building in public is fun :)

**tl;dr:** building an ai interview helper that actually helps you learn, not just copy-paste solutions. wish me luck (and patience for all the edge cases).

stay curious,
